      <td>10/10</td>
      <td> this is actually kind of funny. when i first moved out on my complete own into a studio, i had just my bed, my hundreds of knickknacks, my laptop, and this fucking movie. my parents ended up treating me to a shitty vizio tv that i still have today and absolutely fucking hate. so i replayed this movie about a hundred gazillion times bc its all i had to watch. anyway<br>i actually did quite enjoy it, and was maybe the first movie i was genuinely just, did not expect the ending at all. like it was surprising to me which rarely happens when i watch a movie bc to me, they tend to be predictible. but this was a pretty good one to only have in my possession at the time. it was sort of the beginning of my dvd collection. i like the narrator. i saw myself a lot in him bc i also had an office job that i felt dead at all the time. i could probably recite the entire movie to you. </td>

      <td>4/10</td>
      <td> i heard a lot about this one when it first came out. so when i saw it at a goodwill i ended up getting it and to be frank, i fucking hated it. i still have the dvd surprisingly because i frequently donate my stuff on the regular but i still have this one. the protaganist actually annoyed me to hell and back, and i remember tweeting about it on my small tiny twitter account at the time because it pissed me off so much. the idea was very good and i always enjoy the history of the catacombs but this was... the girl, the protagonist, was the typical horror movie girl who kept pushing forward despite ending up killing her entire group. i don't really remember much of this one. i just remember i really hated it and was shouting at the movie the entire time.</td>

      so this one i really, really, really enjoyed. i watched this one maybe when i was in middle school, or freshman year of high school. i think it was actually the first anime movie i was introducted to. i don't know where i saw it, but i saw it and liked the premise enough. this one is definitely a classic to me, and the inspiration this one caused was amazing. i did read through the manga afterwards, and did sort of feel the ending was lucklaster in both, but i guess it made sense because it's like life kept going for kaneda and yea he misses his friend, but he gotta keep going. idk. i liked it tho. the visuals were great and matched up and lived up to its manga counterpart.<br>if you havent watched this one i really recommened it. but you might have to watch it twice to understand it. maybe.</td>

      <td>10/10</td>
      <td>another movie i watched when i had nothing to do on the weekend. liked it! i watched this one after fight club since i found i really liked david fincher's films. i dont really know what to say about it, but i love thrillers in general and this was a thriller and i loved it. there's some pretty graphic scenes in it i remember my mom cringing at when we watched it later.<br>the ending didnt make me cry, but was definitely saddening. the actions he took made sense, i mean. who wouldnt. i like the old, drabby look it had a lot.</td>

      <td class="TITLE">MAZE RUNNER<br><img src="https://file.garden/ZdmNLegxzVCR-8F4/movies/mazerunner.jpg"></td>
      <td>8/10</td>
      <td>this encapsulates the entire series as a whole: amazing. i really loved it, and the characters in it were all understandable to me. i sort of hate when i see characters exaggerated in certain ways (fucking. as above so below.) but all their actions made <em>sense</em>. i think i watched this one in one sitting, the entire series in one night. i pulled an all nighter i remember.<br>i didnt like teresa tho. i had a talk w my friend before abt this, but i feel it wouldve worked better if they were siblings or something, rather than lovers. the lovers storyline didn't really fit in the whole thing? there didn't feel a need for it. i feel they just saw the girl and boy and were like yeah couples duh. okay well we're both on the ace spectrum so i cant say much in that regard maybe. but it still didnt really work for me. the chase scenes were pretty good. yeah.

      <td>8/10</td>
      <td>this one! this one! this one! loved it. i may be biased bc i tend to like anything with cillian murphy in it bc hes a pretty good fucking actor and i just like his overall vibe, but apocalypse movies i just love in general with thriller. as of now, 2024.12.14, theres a sequel coming called 28 years later and im so so so thrilled for that one. the trailer was good and im excited for it.<br>okay, before i get too into the sequel and my thoughts on it, bc this isnt a sequel review, the ending was extremely sweet. im happy they kept who they chose to live and perhaps mean, they chose who they chose to die. the story worked well and the desolate look of the film was done so well. for it being a movie like this, it had some pretty sweet scenes that sort of squeezed your heart. maybe i just like cillian murphy as an actor. idk.</td>

      <td>7/10</td>
      <td>this one was kinda funny. to me. herbert is an odd guy who says odd things and does odd things and it makes you sort of wonder why dan, of all people, would choose to stick with him for so long. in the second movie they live together at an old funeral home next to a graveyard. its sort of an odd movie for sure. its like a dark comedy? pretty sure. i liked it tho. i didn't expect alot for it being a movie from the 80s, but it was kinda funny. i think you have to watch it more from a humorous perspective than anything else because thats all i can really categorize it in. it's a good movie tho and i recommend it, maybe to like pass some time.</td>
