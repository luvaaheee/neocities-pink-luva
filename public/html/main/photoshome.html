          i'm an avid collector of cameras and try to get them when i'm able to. i have always liked the old grainy film and within the past year got my hands on some cool digicams, one gifted by a friend. i had to scrap a lot of point and shoots and a polaroid due to being too old to keep using. 
       <br><br>i found my first point and shoot at an antique shop in the far back when i was 12, and the owner noticed how entranced i was by it. i never had my own camera and always saw my parents taking photos of me growing up. it was maybe five bucks, i think a Canon powershot, but the owner, a sweet old guy, saw me put it back and immediately grabbed it and stuck it in my hands and said <em>"for free, enjoy it."</em><br>
       i was hooked onto film cameras since. eventually i plan to develop my own film and hopefully have a room in my future home solely for film developing and displaying all my beloved cameras!
       <br><br>
        <em>as a note, if you decide to get a digicam of an older model, you may need to replace the CR1220 battery in order for the date and time to work!</em><br><br><br>

        <summary>NIKON COOLPIX MODEL UNKNOWN</summary>
         <p>so. i lost this one. the reason i put it down is because some photos in my gallery will have this one in use, which is the ones with the date stamp on it. nikon coolpix's line of cameras is perhaps the most popular line of theirs, and has very good quality cameras with the date and time stamps shown on photos. most the time, photos with the date and time stamps from the 2000s will be done with a nikon coolpix. i genuinely loved this one and it took such pretty photos but i took it on a trip with me to rochester, ny for a show and i lost it in the rental car. i was in a rush to board my return flight!<br>
           i speak highly of this one, and if you manage to run across a nikon coolpix for rather cheap, get it! most of them are very good quality in a small body. i loved the large screen on the back of them the most.</p>

       <summary>CANON POWERSHOT A430</summary>
       <p>i am not using this one that often, to be honest.<br>
       i still have to get the new battery for it, since it's stuck on a date from like 2003, and to fix that i need to get a new CR1220 battery. i used it maybe once or twice, which it takes slightly smaller photos, not exactly 4x6 but maybe 3x5? i dont really know when ill reach for this one that often, as i dont really like the newer models of canon as i prefer nikon overall. i actually wanted to return this one as i bought it online but i never got a response back from the seller. not from ebay, but an actual website specializing in older cameras.

       <summary>CANON POWERSHOT SX100 IS</summary>
       <p>this one i was gifted from a friend! this was after my mourning over the nikon one in new york and i ended up going to chicago for a show again with my friends, and my best friend gifted me this one to make up for my lost camera (love you!!)<br>
       i use this one a lot! its body is more similar to what i prefer in cameras with an actual handle and not completely flat, has the option to flip up the flash for photos and takes normal AA batteries (cant count how many random batteries i have lying around for this damn hobby)<br>
         i really love this one, and yes i know i said i prefer nikon overall but this one has more sentimental value due to being gifted. photos come out good and i actually sometimes take photos on my phone and this one interchangably and always prefer the look on this one! it did come with a case but it had sand in it that was endless so i scrapped it. i think it was falling apart actually. but! very good camera, thank u to my best friend, and i always take this one out with me.<br><br>

         <summary>CANON A-1 (currently repairing this one)</summary>
          <p>this one i was gifted from my dad, who got it from his dad. so it's my grandfathers. as of now the shutter does not work. wind film works, the shutter button just doesnt depress. a little unfortunate! do have a place they can fix it inhouse nearby.<br>
       if you heard of film cameras and read about them, you probably heard of its more popular cousin, the Canon AE-1. i dont remember the exact differences, but theyre pretty similar overall. i think theyre both great but i know lots of people tend to prefer one over the other for their own style of shooting. this was my first one and i was able to use it for about one film roll before the ISO dial stopped working (i wanted to try 400 ISO but it was stuck on 200), so i sent it in for repairs, then it came back with the shutter not working. so! to repairs again.

         <summary>PENTAX ME</summary>
         <p>another one of my grandfathers. this one has his name engraved on the bottom so very cool family thing to have :) i love and reach for this one the most, its rather simple and can be used as a point and shoot (sorta- still have to set the aperature!). has a locking mechanism (which i forget about a lot). the shutter sound is less clicky and more solid feeling, very nice. smallest film cam i have at this moment, and the lightest by far. i have used about a dozen rolls with this one and love it!

        <summary>OLYMPUS iS-20</summary>
        <p>found at a goodwill for 14 bucks. i am slowly getting a hang of this one, has a bit of a learning curve compared to regular film cameras. when i first saw it i thought it was a digicam!<br>
       heavy, not as heavy as the Canon A1 but still up there, a little chunkier to carry aorund. surprisingly had the original strap with it still, so was very well taken care of. the batteries are $20 for two, which, <em>sucks</em>. if you notice in the photos, theres no film advance lever! this one <em>automatically</em> winds the film, in loading and rewinding. theres no aperature setting or shutter speed to pick either. so its a point and shoot, but slightly fancier. the settings are mostly based on the focusing and light, as it picks the settings for both itself.

       <summary>HOLGA 120S</summary>
       <p>a toy camera! this one is made from the 80s and something i was eyeing for a few years. i got it in dec 24' at a goodwill for like three bucks? this one takes 120 film and is made entirely of plastic. theres no holder for the film in the back of it, and is completely manual. so since theres no mechanism that holds the film completely flat like in other cameras, light leaks are very common and apparent in the photos. thats what gives it it's charm. the only settings in it are for adjusting if you're taking a portrait or a landscape, and sunny or cloudy days. no numbers, no B mode, no locking mechanism, and the back is held in place very flimsy by some cheap plastic.<br>
         now, besides all that, its fun! theres no seriousness in taking photos and its just point and shoot, then develop your film. only complaint i have is that the film wind knob tends to move without me intending to. even when i place it upside and know i dont bother it, somehow the film winds. i know since the back has a window which shows what frame you're on (printed on the film itself) and sometimes is moved. sort of annoying, and im sort of expecting my photos to come out wonky. but again, <em>that's</em> the charm.
