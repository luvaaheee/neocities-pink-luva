      ah. more about me?<br>
      i guess. i recently got into coding about a year ago (circa jan 2024) and wanted to build a website that contains everything i do. i also would like for it to end up becoming a capsule of sorts that i keep updating and updating.<br>i live alone with my cat and go to school part time while working full time. the end goal is something i am not sure of, but i know i want to move out of this fuckass city i live in. i've been drawing since i was a kid and have had various social media accounts since i was about 12. which i don't think was a very good thing at all, but i suppose i know about a lot of older internet things, if that's something. i've been posting art since i was 14, originally on an instagram account that amassed a decent amount of followers, but i didn't like knowing so many people were looking and seeing my stuff so i deleted it in 2017 and restarted. i originally started on tumblr and expanded more into other sites. it reminds me maybe i should look into doing my spacehey account again, since i know more about web customization.. <br>
      anyway! i hope you don't remember my old accounts. in a way i miss it as going through the roughest parts of my childhood it ended up becoming a sort of escape for me, as the internet has always been. i could be anyone on it and no one knew any better. so in a way i've always been on the internet since a child, and always admired artists and webdesigners in particular. i enjoyed youtube, but it wasn't something that piqued my interest as much.<br>
      i collect old tech, of mostly cameras and cd players and have gone through various setups of my media center. i only have one picture i took of my old setup and as of now, i live in a tiny studio and plan to leave to a new city sometime soon, so i haven't been buying much and rather donating whatever i can to prepare for the move.<br>

        then the cameras i decided to keep after downsizing my collection by about 6 cameras... lol. <br>

      <br>then my music tastes have tended to stay the same from like. a kid. i feel everyone had a period where they listened to skrillex, if you grew up on the internet then like dubstep and such. but yeah i enjoy concerts and raves which in my personal opinion tend to be way more fun than clubs. i think what people have in mind of clubs is what raves actually are, with the dancing and more flashing lights. still drinks there. yes i go alone, i don't really enjoy going to those sorts of things with other people as all my experiences with others have been tainted in some way. i tend to keep to myself at these places anyway as i like just soaking it in by myself, but had on the occasion been bothered by others. i dont know. im not a social person in any way, if the indication of living by myself despite barely scraping by wasn't enough. i say live alone but i do live with a cat. how do i afford that? well i placed her as an ESA and most places let me keep her without the horrendous pet fees they charge. like theyre the ones taking care and cleaning after pets...
