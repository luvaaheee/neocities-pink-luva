    got a job. im gonna immediately die now. <br>no but starting a new job is always a hassle to deal with, with the onboarding and training and paperwork and learning new names and aghhghg. got two job offers but one starts the day i need rent due so i decided to overlap them and start one of them next week to atleast make rent, because thats the point of this job... to make rent...<br>
    i played some guitar hero that im gonna link cus i wanted to record it. i got a tripod for my cameras so i can finally take long exposure and night shots. ive been wanting to do one, then im going on a weekend trip w my mom and where we r going is very pretty. my wii broke. after the guitar hero, which was so sad. i dont know what to do about it. i wanted to play more but the disc loading has a gear wrong somewhere, or something since it cant seem to load the disc in right at all. just turns and turns but doesnt actually catch the disc. oh well... <br>

  <p>happy new year. wont lie, it feels insane to live this far compared to what i thought in high school. anyway<br>
  switched to linux finally. ive been meaning to and settled on linux mint, eventually i would like to delve deeper and explore other distros, but for now i think this is a good learning point to start off. the customization i spent all day on lol. otherwise i've been enjoying it and getting better hang of the command lines and terminal and everything. i think getting one of my old laptops and loading it with another linux distro thats more in depth would also be good practice too. maybe use it as a coding one specifically? i still would like a raspberry pi to host my website on too. then a new keyboard would be nice...<br>
  ahead of myself. but the new years has been nice! my old job closed down the office i worked at. so i dropped by to chat with my old boss and she gave me a monitor and some other things that is going to save me so much money in the long run. dont have to buy toilet paper for a long fucking while (and its the nicer ones!!) filled out my fafsa... going to my cities downtown party this friday, which they do monthly. drinks and vendors and food and live music. excited for that. not much else otherwise!</p></details>

<p>there is something about being misgendered by your family yet still being perceived correctly by everyone else. incorrect. correct. correct. correct. correct. correct. incorrect. correct. <br>
i know who i am, so it shouldnt matter so much, but this is my family. when the thoughts of these people matter more than the billions on this earth combined. its something im trying to unlearn each day, because at the end of it no matter what they say can dissuade me from feeling happier when it comes back correct. there is no one else in this body but mine, so therefore what i think what makes me happy, that i know makes me happy, is what ill go after. theres no other goal for me but happiness and comfort.</p></details>

  <p>tired. my sleep is completely fucked and i have abt three interviews coming up to do. unemployed for two weeks now? not super stressed since i have rent for january covered, mostly worried for february but the interviews i got will manage to cover rent in one paycheck if i get any of those jobs. my past time has been spent scrolling through neocities and taking notes of things id like to eventually add to my own website. im mostly happy with how its turning out, but would like to make it more busy with stickers on the edges and add in a site map maybe.<br>
  it's cold in my apartment right now. but it gets so warm when i put the heater on, so im having my most trouble this week with fighting with the thermostat. my cat is keeping me busy by attacking me when shes hyper then snuggling with me when its bedtime. or whenever i end up passing out. i dropped off my cousin at the airport last night then drove around for two more hours and went up to my cities mountain and took some pictures. i find i like how my photos look more on my digicam than my phone, which feels insane since i thought my phone camera would take better photos. but the digicam comes out more, somehow sharper. the grain maybe? i need to get a camera tripod for night shots. they have some at goodwill usually. a small one will do.<br>
  i need to send my friends xmas gifts out. but one is in another country i cant ship to right now and another is on a trip, and i cant send either packages out in fear they both will get lost. excited to eat my oven pizza tonight.<br>
  i miss my old camera</p></details>

  <p>i currently am having trouble sleeping. i have no urge to sleep despite being awake for the whole day and some. i took a shower and am making tea but it feels wasteful to sleep now when ill only be sleeping and wasting away my saturday. my cat is hyper and playing fetch in my tiny apartment with me.<br>
  i always enjoyed reading other people's journals or diaries in their websites. it was always interesting to me. i'm thinking of adding in the movie and books log i've been wanting to do for a bit, if i can't seem to sleep i may as well do the things i've been thinking of. i've been wanting to build my own keyboard, maybe the 40% ones. i always liked the look of those and it would be a fun little thing to own and i think it would be interesting to build. i still want a macropad but those i'll prob tinker with some more to program the shortcuts and such. and then i'm thinking of buying an old monitor to mess with, maybe build a mini computer out of one of those raspberry pi thingies. lots of ideas.<br>
  still upset i busted my computer speakers. i jammed the audio cable on accident while i was plugging it in and it split in two. i managed to put it back together but now only the left speaker works, but there has to be a way to rewire it back to normal. gonna have to look into that more.<br>
  still the 14th. i want to put down this video i saw on youtube that immediately captivated me: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmWMgAnPrE0">Rito to Hateno - Morning Easy Run - BotW Treadmill Run Along</a></p></details>

  <p>hi! i've been wanting to revamp this website for awhile. i'm not exactly sure what sort of stuff i will put here specifically, perhaps photos of interesting things i see and any updates to this website. <br>
  some new things and what's planned: adding in a movie log, book log (to encourage myself to read more), and film (camera film i mean. not movie films.) ratings. i love trying new film and have a nearby camera shop that develops film i'm interested in having my stuff developed there on the regular. have about three rolls to develop? i found another old film canister that is used, i think it's a kodak 400 film. or fujifilm...<br>
  i finished my semester today! had my finals while i sat at a laundromat waiting for my clothes to finish drying. insanely relieved. have some interviews to do this week ^^ aiming for a better paying job i suppose. living happy rn!</p>
