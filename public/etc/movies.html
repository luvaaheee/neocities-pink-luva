      <td> this is actually kind of funny. when i first moved out on my complete own into a studio, i had just my bed, my hundreds of knickknacks, my laptop, and this fucking movie. my parents ended up treating me to a shitty vizio tv that i still have today and absolutely fucking hate. so i replayed this movie about a hundred gazillion times bc its all i had to watch. anyway<br>i actually did quite enjoy it, and was maybe the first movie i was genuinely just, did not expect the ending at all. like it was surprising to me which rarely happens when i watch a movie bc to me, they tend to be predictible. but this was a pretty good one to only have in my possession at the time. it was sort of the beginning of my dvd collection. i like the narrator. i saw myself a lot in him bc i also had an office job that i felt dead at all the time. i could probably recite the entire movie to you. </td>

      <td>4/10</td>
      <td> i heard a lot about this one when it first came out. so when i saw it at a goodwill i ended up getting it and to be frank, i fucking hated it. i still have the dvd surprisingly because i frequently donate my stuff on the regular but i still have this one. the protaganist actually annoyed me to hell and back, and i remember tweeting about it on my small tiny twitter account at the time because it pissed me off so much. the idea was very good and i always enjoy the history of the catacombs but this was... the girl, the protagonist, was the typical horror movie girl who kept pushing forward despite ending up killing her entire group. i don't really remember much of this one. i just remember i really hated it and was shouting at the movie the entire time.</td>

      so this one i really, really, really enjoyed. i watched this one maybe when i was in middle school, or freshman year of high school. i think it was actually the first anime movie i was introducted to. i don't know where i saw it, but i saw it and liked the premise enough. this one is definitely a classic to me, and the inspiration this one caused was amazing. i did read through the manga afterwards, and did sort of feel the ending was lucklaster in both, but i guess it made sense because it's like life kept going for kaneda and yea he misses his friend, but he gotta keep going. idk. i liked it tho. the visuals were great and matched up and lived up to its manga counterpart.<br>if you havent watched this one i really recommened it. but you might have to watch it twice to understand it. maybe.</td>

      <td>another movie i watched when i had nothing to do on the weekend. liked it! i watched this one after fight club since i found i really liked david fincher's films. i dont really know what to say about it, but i love thrillers in general and this was a thriller and i loved it. there's some pretty graphic scenes in it i remember my mom cringing at when we watched it later.<br>the ending didnt make me cry, but was definitely saddening. the actions he took made sense, i mean. who wouldnt. i like the old, drabby look it had a lot.</td>

      <td>8/10</td>
      <td>this encapsulates the entire series as a whole: amazing. i really loved it, and the characters in it were all understandable to me. i sort of hate when i see characters exaggerated in certain ways (fucking. as above so below.) but all their actions made <em>sense</em>. i think i watched this one in one sitting, the entire series in one night. i pulled an all nighter i remember.<br>i didnt like teresa tho. i had a talk w my friend before abt this, but i feel it wouldve worked better if they were siblings or something, rather than lovers. the lovers storyline didn't really fit in the whole thing? there didn't feel a need for it. i feel they just saw the girl and boy and were like yeah couples duh. okay well we're both on the ace spectrum so i cant say much in that regard maybe. but it still didnt really work for me. the chase scenes were pretty good. yeah.

      <td>8/10</td>
      <td>this one! this one! this one! loved it. i may be biased bc i tend to like anything with cillian murphy in it bc hes a pretty good fucking actor and i just like his overall vibe, but apocalypse movies i just love in general with thriller. as of now, 2024.12.14, theres a sequel coming called 28 years later and im so so so thrilled for that one. the trailer was good and im excited for it.<br>okay, before i get too into the sequel and my thoughts on it, bc this isnt a sequel review, the ending was extremely sweet. im happy they kept who they chose to live and perhaps mean, they chose who they chose to die. the story worked well and the desolate look of the film was done so well. for it being a movie like this, it had some pretty sweet scenes that sort of squeezed your heart. maybe i just like cillian murphy as an actor. idk.</td>

      <td>7/10</td>
      <td>this one was kinda funny. to me. herbert is an odd guy who says odd things and does odd things and it makes you sort of wonder why dan, of all people, would choose to stick with him for so long. in the second movie they live together at an old funeral home next to a graveyard. its sort of an odd movie for sure. its like a dark comedy? pretty sure. i liked it tho. i didn't expect alot for it being a movie from the 80s, but it was kinda funny. i think you have to watch it more from a humorous perspective than anything else because thats all i can really categorize it in. it's a good movie tho and i recommend it, maybe to like pass some time.</td>

      <td class="TITLE">ANORA<br><img src="https://file.garden/ZdmNLegxzVCR-8F4/movies/anora.jpg"></td>
      <td>7/10</td>
      <td>i dont even know. whats the genre? romcom. it was actually more depressing i just remember it as depressing more than anything else. anora deserved so much more and igor was so nice to her through it all. i think igor was my fave, he was sorta weird but it added to the charm of him and anora as a possible couple .. ? maybe. but the ending is quiet and sad to sit in when the movie ends, it really makes u think about relationships and just. how insanely crazy rich people are. im not super into romcoms like at all, its never been my sort of thing but i wouldnt categorize this as a romcom more of like, i dont know. not romance cus its more depressing but its also funny cus the russian guys are just funny to anora being anora. tragic romcom. i wouldnt rewatch it but its def one i would recommend.</td>

      <td class="TITLE">THE MATRIX<br><img src="https://file.garden/ZdmNLegxzVCR-8F4/movies/thematrix.jpg"></td>
      <td>9/10</td>
      <td>good movie. i enjoyed it a lot! i really never had much interest in the matrix movies or movies in general up until recently, and i figured starting off my movie journey with a classic was a good spot to begin. <br>
      i love neo, and to be honest, i about love anything that is keanu reeves. i know some people say he isnt super expressive and isnt that great of an actor, but theres a charm about him that just makes every character he plays seem more real, even if they  all tend to be nonchalant. i dont know, i just really love keanu reeves, and about soak up every movie with him starring. the matrix was a cool premise and i loved the story, and it really hits that 2000s spot that people rave about having an old technology feel.

        holy fucking moly! i always heard so many good things about this one, but i really wasnt sure what i was expecting. this is a movie younger me would have loved, when i was big in my phase of space exploration and considering going into mathematics as a degree as well. <br>
        if you dont really pay attention, i can definitely see how easy it is to get lost within it. but i loved TARS and the planet they landed on and the music, then i did know about the ticking representing so many years on earth passing, but it still left me in awe when the end credits rolled. each character was fleshed out well, which i found some movies can lack on easily and focus more on the plot, but the plot and characters rolled together so well. i would definitely watch it again.

      <td>8/10</td>
      <td>
        wont lie. im being generous with the rating here. theres a scene in here that made me dry heave. no i wont explain which one and why.<br>
        i like darker films, theres no doubt about it. i love the darker storylines, and the desperation they can have and the suspense and every negative little scary feeling the characters can feel, that you <em>feel</em> from the screen. this was it. although it did bring up negative memories for me, it still left me sitting there at the end in a sort of daze. i love when movies do that. its a good movie, something to absolutely prepare yourself for because there are <em>scenes</em> that will leave you nauseous in some way. any way. its a good movie, but i dont think its one i can sit myself through again. i initially planned on watching this with my boyfriend, but i watched it alone at first unplanned and resolutely decided afterwards we are not watching it, because i would have to sit through it again and i dont think i can, mentally. he can watch it himself though, just not with me... cannot stomach it.
