     <a href="../diary.html">go back?</a><br><br>
     hello! welcome to the page where i will ramble about various stationery and how i use my journal system<br>
     i have always been super interested in journals, planners, and stationery for a very long time, finding absolute joy in using them all the time. it's one of my guilty pleasures and something i always felt sort of nerdy about? i feel it's not a common thing to be super interested in as i rarely met other people who are into it as much as i am.<br><br>
     for my system i use a sketchbook/commonplace, a planner, and a journal/diary. i have trouble remembering stuff a lot and my boyfriend also has a habit of forgetting his own plans, so i have taken to writing down any appointments, plans, or to dos we have (we're together a lot and tend to switch out who uses my car for errands and plans) <br><br>

     <h2>SKETCHBOOK</h2><br>

     my sketcbook/commonplace! i used this primarily as a sketchbook in the beginning, but it soon started morphing into a catch-all for my ideas and such, so it has taken on to become a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commonplace_book" target="_blank">commonplace</a> book for me. i adapted a key system to keep track of my notes and what i'm writing down. very simple, nothing overly extravagant.<br>
     some examples i picked is: a page of drawings i did planning out an eventual keychain to get my boyfriend of me :3, notes from school and some drawing ideas i have to eventually explore, and project ideas. there's a page of self-help tips i've been practicing and a quote i really liked. opening this book has been very enjoyable and a constant reminder of stuff i can work on and has really helped me in focusing on projects i want to do. having a physical place to draw inspiration from is nice! i really recommend it, rather than saving posts on social media or endlessly scrolling on pinterest instead. a physical catch-all i can carry around and draw in has been wonderful.<br><br>

     <h2>FILOFAX</h2><br>

     next up is my filofax. i own a personal size compact saffiano <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Filofax-Saffiano-Organizer-Personal-Compact/dp/B0DHLVXYM5" target="_blank">[link]</a>. i used to use this a planner, but 2026 i plan to switch back to a hobonichi weeks for my planning. i had different sections during my use: first tab as the monthly calendars, second tab my weekly view for writing down day to day tasks, third tab for notes and other important information, and fourth tab as a mini journal when this was all i carried and didn't have my actual journal with me. liked it but i found i preferred a bound notebook in the end. don't have much ideas for this one anymore and am unsure on what to do with it unfortunately...<br><br>

     <h2>JOURNAL</h2><br>
    <img src="https://file.garden/ZdmNLegxzVCR-8F4/photos/journal%20system/moleskineexpanded.jpg"><br><br>
    moleskine expanded journal softcover! i use this one to write down all my thoughts and to pretty much get anything that's stuck in my head OUT of my head. it's plain with no stickers currently. just a diary essentially<br><br>

    <h2>HOBONICHI WEEKS 2026</h2><br>
    <img src="https://file.garden/ZdmNLegxzVCR-8F4/photos/journal%20system/system_8.jpg"><br><br>
    next is for 2026: i decided to use a hobonichi weeks! i have been using hobonichi since 2021, starting off with the english techo a6, then switching to the original a6 for two years, then settling on the weeks for the past few years. i love the paper in hobonichi and really enjoy having a small archive of my life!<br>
    this one for 2026 will be no-frills planning, as shown above (from 2024). i enjoy the journaling i see people do it in, but i will be delegating that to the cousin size i got as well ^^<br>
    i just stick with the pen you're given when you buy a hobonichi, and one highlighter for more important events. the yearly spread i will try (keyword:<em>try</em>) to use it as a mood tracker. the memo pages i use for whatever, typically ends up as my work notes or school notes. or just phone numbers or emails i need later on. passwords. the usual!<br><br>

    <h2>DAILY SKETCH DIARY 2026</h2><br>
    <img src="https://file.garden/ZdmNLegxzVCR-8F4/photos/journal%20system/system_9.jpg"><br><br>
    this one is a little diary i picked up in LA in Kinokuniya USA Bookstore! (absolute joy to be in! this store was essentially everything my boyfriend and i are interested in hobby wise-- gundam, art, journals, manga, stationery, miniatures and knick knacks) and it is all in japanese, but has nice thin smooth cream paper, and is plain!<br>
    this one for 2026 will be a daily sketch diary, as i desperatly need to get back into drawing again. it's small in size, hovering around postcard size of 4x6in, so i think it will be less stressful to keep up with it. even simple pen sketches each day is enough for me. really looking forward to using this one.<br><br>

    <h2>HOBONICHI COUSIN HON 2026</h2><br>
    <img src="https://file.garden/ZdmNLegxzVCR-8F4/photos/journal%20system/hon.jpg">
    <img src="https://file.garden/ZdmNLegxzVCR-8F4/photos/journal%20system/hon_2.jpg"><br><br>
    the hon! when these first were released, i fell in love. i love the idea of it being more similar to a book, and still being able to write my own entries in it. a personal archive.<br>
    this one will perhaps be more of my journal, where i write down what i did each day (try to, anyway) and paste in any receipts and stickers i get day to day. again, my boyfriend and i go to a lot of places together and he also has a thing for saving movie tickets, cool receipts, flyers, product tags, and business cards. i see this as an excellent opportunity to be able to paste all the little loose papers we keep between us in a little diary book to look back in. i do a lot day to day now that i'd like to be able to look back on and remember what i did a particular day instead of having a steady brain fog.<br><br>
