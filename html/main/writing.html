           <p><em>You are everything I could be and I’m everything you could have been.</em><br><br>

In every negative and positive sense of the phrase. The same things that leave me jolting awake in the middle of the night are the same things that leave me searching for you everywhere I go. <br><br>

You’re right there at the tips of my fingers but I couldn’t have felt farther from you- I have the same eyes as you. <br>
How do I have the same eyes as you but when I stare at them, I feel dread? <br>
           There’s that smell wafting off of you. <em>You are everything I could be.</em><br><br>

           I’m staring at the door. I feel your fingers on my arms, searching, searching, <em>searching.</em><br>
They might as well feel the same as everything else I pressed to them. <br>
Blunt and forceful. Intentional. <br>
Your eyes match mine this time, but it doesn’t feel as nice as I hoped it to be. <em>I’m everything you could have been.</em><br><br></p>
